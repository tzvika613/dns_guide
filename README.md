DNS_Guide_for _oppresive_regimes

Every authoritarian system has learned to weaponize DNS, metadata, protocol misconfigurations, and passive traffic analysis. It is cheap, silent, scalable, and impossible for the victim to notice.

Chapter 17 explains:

how ISPs, WiFi owners, filtering units, and security services reconstruct your activity

why DNS is only the first leak (SNI, IP patterns, timing correlation)

why ECH is blocked in Russia and China, and how that exposes you

the three separate DNS enemies every user faces

the Android Private DNS boot-leak that affects millions

how systemd-resolved leaks DNS even with VPN active

how to safely pass airport/hotel captive portals

what works in Iran/Russia/China in 2025 and what is already dead

why traffic obfuscation matters more than encryption

what DNS can do for you — and what it cannot

This chapter is not theoretical.
Everything inside it has happened.
Some of it is happening right now as you read.
